## Description

As a developer, a README file is something you write so often that it is quite a relief when you can just focus on content and leave the structure of your README file to a tool. This application will lead you through a number of questions and use your provided input to generate a README.md file to be included in your Github project. The file will be saved as GEN_README.md in your project's root folder. It also will ask you to select a license of choice and then populate your README file with details along with a badge for your specific license.
